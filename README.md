# RainAlert
This Python script fetches short-term weather forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API and sends SMS alerts via Twilio if rain is predicted in the next few hours. Ideal for personal weather alerts, the script can be automated using platforms like PythonAnywhere for scheduled daily execution.
